# AdventOfCode
AdventOfCode is an Advent Calendar but instead of having chocolate you have to solve a puzzle every day. 
It is divided into two parts based on the same theme.

You can find here my Advent of code solutions with the golang language. I chose it because it is the one I use every day and that I want to continue to improve for the moment.
