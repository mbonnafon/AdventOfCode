# AdventOfCode
AdventOfCode is an Advent Calendar but instead of having chocolate you have to solve a puzzle every day. 
It is divided into two parts based on the same theme.

Here, you can find my Advent of code solutions submitted with the golang language. I chose it because it is the one I use every day and that I want to continue to improve for the moment.

If you see any improvement areas, don't hesitate to send me a mail and I'll update the code, if it's relevant.
